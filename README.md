 # Local-Market-Analytics-LMA ML Dashboard ðŸ“Š

## Project Overview

This project provides a comparative performance dashboard and a prediction interface for machine learning models developed to analyze local commerce data. The models are built using Python (Scikit-learn) and deployed using the Flask microframework, featuring a clean, responsive web interface.

### Key Models & Goals:

1.  **Linear Regression:** Predicts **Business Sales Target** based on features like Review Count, Average Rating, and Promotional Activity.
2.  **Decision Tree Classifier:** Predicts **User Segment** (e.g., 'High Value', 'Budget Conscious') based on demographic and spending habits.
3.  **Logistic Regression:** Predicts **Interaction Conversion** (Yes/No) based on interaction features like Distance and Time Spent.
4.  **K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN):** Predicts **User Segment** using a combination of all available User, Business, and Interaction features.
